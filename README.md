# OOP and SOLID Principles Paint Application

This project is a C#.NET implementation of a basic paint application restructured to follow Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and SOLID design principles, offering a foundation that is open for extension and modification.

## Overview

The application serves as a digital canvas where users can draw, choose custom colors, and use basic tools like a pen and eraser. Adhering to the SOLID principles ensures that each class and module is designed to be maintainable, scalable, and easily understandable.

## Features

- **Canvas**: A drawable area that registers user input and displays the resulting graphics.
- **Color Picker**: An RGBA color selection tool for custom color creation.
- **Tool Selection**: Switch between drawing and erasing on the canvas.
- **Menu Options**:
  - **Import**: Load existing images onto the canvas for editing.
  - **Save**: Save the current canvas state as an image file.
  - **New Canvas**: Reset the canvas for a new drawing.
